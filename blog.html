                    <h2>New ESA Amendments: What Employers Need to Know (2025)</h2>
                    <p class="blog-excerpt">Ontario's employment-law landscape continues to change.</p>
                    <div class="blog-body">
                        <p>As of July 1, 2025, the <strong>Digital Platform Workers' Rights Act, 2022</strong> took effect, introducing meaningful new standards for workers engaged through digital platforms — often referred to as "gig workers."</p>
                        
                        <h3>What's Actually Changed</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Gig Worker Protections</h4>
                        <p>✔ The new law introduces baseline protections for people doing digital platform work (such as rideshare, delivery, or courier services). These include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A guaranteed minimum wage for active work assignments (based on Ontario's ESA minimum wage).</li>
                            <li>Required transparency about pay calculation and criteria for offering work.</li>
                            <li>Regular pay periods and paydays.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Important note:</strong> This law doesn't automatically make gig workers "employees" under the ESA, but it does create enforceable rights and obligations for platform operators.</p>

                        <h4>Remote Work (OHSA Amendments)</h4>
                        <p>Ontario's Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) now explicitly applies to remote work, including virtual workplace harassment and health and safety obligations at or near an employee's home.</p>

                        <h4>Sick Leave Documentation</h4>
                        <p>Employers cannot require a medical note (a "sick note") from a qualified health practitioner for an employee's ESA sick leave. Employers can still ask for reasonable evidence that an employee is eligible for the leave, just not a doctor's certificate.</p>

                        <h4>Job Posting & Information Requirements (Coming in 2026)</h4>
                        <p>Employers with 25+ employees will soon need to include salary ranges and other details in publicly advertised job postings and retain related documentation. These changes start January 1, 2026.</p>

                        <h4>Penalties & Enforcement</h4>
                        <p>The maximum fine for individuals convicted of certain ESA offences is now up to $100,000 (up from $50,000).</p>

                        <h3>What This Means for Employers</h3>
                        <p>To stay ahead:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Review policies and contracts for sick leave, remote work, job postings, and gig work obligations.</li>
                            <li>Train HR and managers about the new remote work safety provisions and evidence requirements.</li>
                            <li>Communicate clearly with workers about information you collect, how pay is calculated, and their rights under the new digital platform worker standards.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Working for Workers Act, 2024: Strengthening Employee Protections</h2>
                    <p class="blog-excerpt">The Working for Workers Act, 2024 builds on Ontario's earlier reforms and introduces several important updates you should know.</p>
                    <div class="blog-body">
                        <h3>Key Provisions</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Paid Sick Days</h4>
                        <p>Ontario currently provides three <strong>unpaid</strong> ESA sick days (not paid days) — and employers cannot require a sick note for these absences. If you've heard of paid sick days being introduced, that was a proposal but has not been enacted at this time.</p>

                        <h4>Non-Compete Restrictions</h4>
                        <p>The law restricts non-compete clauses for lower-paid employees, generally making them unenforceable for many workers earning less than a prescribed threshold. This continues Ontario's trend of limiting non-competes.</p>

                        <h4>Electronic Monitoring Disclosure</h4>
                        <p>Employers with 25+ employees must provide written policies on how and when they monitor employees electronically. This requirement arose from earlier "Working for Workers" reforms.</p>

                        <h4>Scheduling Changes</h4>
                        <p>While Ontario has rules about scheduling and providing reasonable notice of changes, there isn't currently a legislated 96-hour notice right for shift changes outside specific industries or collective agreements. You should check your particular sector's rules.</p>

                        <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Update employment agreements to reflect the enforceability of non-compete restrictions.</li>
                            <li>Create clear electronic monitoring policies that describe what data you collect and why.</li>
                            <li>Ensure sick-leave processes don't require medical notes but do encourage open communication about absences.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This isn't just compliance — it's a chance to build trust by being transparent and fair with your workers.</p>

                    <h2>ESA Enforcement Updates: What's Changed and Why It Matters</h2>
                    <p class="blog-excerpt">In recent years, Ontario has signaled stronger enforcement of the Employment Standards Act (ESA).</p>
                    <div class="blog-body">
                        <p>Here's what employers should know:</p>
                        
                        <h3>Increased Penalties</h3>
                        <p>Maximum fines for individuals convicted of certain ESA violations have doubled (e.g., up to $100,000).</p>

                        <h3>Compliance Focus</h3>
                        <p>While the Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development regularly conducts compliance inspections, there hasn't been a formal public strategy uniquely targeting sectors like hospitality or temp agencies — but proactive audits remain a best practice.</p>

                        <h3>Public Disclosure</h3>
                        <p>Ontario has the authority to publicize serious or repeated ESA violations, which can impact reputation and business relationships.</p>

                        <h3>Director Liability</h3>
                        <p>Directors and officers may face personal liability in serious cases such as wage theft — a reminder to keep compliance visible at the leadership level.</p>

                        <h3>Best Practices for Employers</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do self-audits regularly across payroll, overtime, vacation pay, and other ESA basics.</li>
                            <li>Keep accurate records (hours, wages, leaves) in case of inspection.</li>
                            <li>Train HR and supervisors on ESA updates and enforcement trends.</li>
                            <li>Consider external reviews if you operate in a complex or fast-growing environment.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Compliance isn't optional — it protects your workers and your organization.</p>
